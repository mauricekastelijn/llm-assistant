# **Project Specification Document**

This specification outlines the development of a modular personal assistant web application with integrated generative AI capabilities. The focus is on building an MVP that adheres to best practices in software architecture, with an eye toward future expansion and platformization. By leveraging open-source technologies and maintaining a clean separation between reusable components and app-specific code, the project aims to produce a flexible, maintainable, and scalable solution.

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**

To develop a **personal assistant web application** with a web-based frontend and a hosted backend. The application should:

- Be deployable both **locally** and in the **cloud**.
- Include **Generative AI** and **Large Language Model (LLM)** functionalities with **agentic behavior**.
- Process and maintain **user-specific data** across application sessions.
- Connect agents to **user-provided data sources** (e.g., through third-party APIs or databases).
- Be modular to facilitate the **reuse of components** in future applications.

## **Technical Guidelines and Constraints**

### **Technologies and Tools**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **LLM Hosting**: Ollama (Dockerized)
- **Agent Framework**: LangChain
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Development Environment**: VS Code with Dev Containers
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for production), SQLite (for MVP)
- **Ecosystem**:

  - Open-source libraries and frameworks only.
  - Industry-standard technologies for broad compatibility.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Simplicity and Power**: Codebase should be simple yet powerful, focusing on readability and efficiency.
- **Maintainability**: The application should be easy to maintain and extend.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for both local and cloud deployments.
- **Modularity**: Emphasize modularity to facilitate reuse in future projects.
- **Open-Source**: Leverage only open-source technologies to avoid licensing issues.

## **Architectural Considerations**

### **Modularity and Reusability**

- **Layered Architecture**: Separate concerns into presentation, business logic, data access, and agents.
- **Pluggable Agents**: Design agents as plugins with a standard interface for easy integration and reuse.
- **Microservices (Future Consideration)**: While not necessary for the MVP, consider microservices for scalability in future iterations.

### **Backend Organization**

- **Reusable Components**: Identify and abstract reusable elements into separate modules or packages.
- **App-Specific Implementations**: Keep app-domain-specific code isolated from reusable components.
- **Interfaces and Contracts**: Define clear interfaces using abstract base classes or protocols.

### **Data Management**

- **State Persistence**: Implement mechanisms to maintain user state and 'memory' across sessions.
- **Data Access Layer**: Abstract data source connections to support multiple databases or APIs.
- **Security**: Ensure data security through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### **Frontend-Backend Communication**

- **API Design**: Use RESTful APIs with JSON serialization.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Optionally implement WebSockets for real-time updates.
- **Documentation**: Utilize OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation.

## **Guardrails**

### **Code Quality**

- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code and appropriate standards for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings and comments where necessary; maintain comprehensive README and developer guides.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability.

### **Security**

- **Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication, preferably using JWT tokens.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data and follow best practices for data storage.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

### **Performance**

- **Efficient Algorithms**: Optimize code for performance where necessary.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle increased load with minimal refactoring.

### **Deployment**

- **Consistency**: Use Docker to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage configurations through environment variables for flexibility.
